"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). _x000D_
_x000D_
I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. _x000D_
_x000D_
I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone._x000D_

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not.
